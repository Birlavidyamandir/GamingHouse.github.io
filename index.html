  <p>Sony recently hosted a PS5 showcase event which offered a good look<br> at what consumers can expect from the upcoming next-generation<br> console. The event primarily focused on PS5 games coming at launch<br> "and beyond," as well as finally confirming PS5's price and release date.<br> Afterwards, we also found out that PS5 preorders would be going live<br> the next day. As it turns out, preorders ended up going live early and<br> without prior notice at nearly every major retailer. However, don't worry<br> if you didn't get yours, as more orders should be available prior to<br> launch--keep an eye on our PS5 preorder guide for more.</p></font></center>

    <p>Games Introduced in event:</p></font>
    <font size="5px">
    <p>1. Final Fantasy XVI <br>
       2. Spider-Man: Miles Morales <br>
       3. Hogwarts Legacy <br>
       4. Demon's Souls Remake <br>
       5. God Of War Rangnarok <br></p>
