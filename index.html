  <p>Sony recently hosted a PS5 showcase event which offered a good look<br> at what consumers can expect from the upcoming next-generation<br> console. The event primarily focused on PS5 games coming at launch<br> "and beyond," as well as finally confirming PS5's price and release date.<br> Afterwards, we also found out that PS5 preorders would be going live<br> the next day. As it turns out, preorders ended up going live early and<br> without prior notice at nearly every major retailer. However, don't worry<br> if you didn't get yours, as more orders should be available prior to<br> launch--keep an eye on our PS5 preorder guide for more.</p></font></center>
  <font size="10px">
    <p>Games Introduced in event:</p></font>
    <font size="5px">
    <p>1. Final Fantasy XVI <br>
       2. Spider-Man: Miles Morales <br>
       3. Hogwarts Legacy <br>
       4. Demon's Souls Remake <br>
       5. God Of War Rangnarok <br></p>

<p>Fortnite: Stark Industries, New Landmark & POI</p></center></font>

<p>Stark Industries is the new zone available since v14.10 in Fortnite. You go<br> there mostly to recover Iron Man's powers or to drive the custom cars,<br> waiting in the garage.<br>
  <br>
  To the northeast of the Authority, an entire area of the map has just been raised<br> off the ground in Fortnite Patch Notes 14.10. This is where you'll find the Stark<br> Industries — a new POI featuring Iron Man and everything associated with him<br> in the Marvel universe.<br></p></font></center>

  <p>Star Industries doesn't look like a big building like in the movies, but like a<br> building built lengthwise with a heliport and a hangar. Among the different points<br> of interest in the area we can mention :<br>
    <br>
    <br>
   1. Three Iron Man cars that are significantly faster than a normal car. One is<br> parked in front of the main building and two are in the garage on the first<br> floor of the main building.<br>
   <br>
   2. The helicopter on the heliport in front of the main building.<br>
   <br>
   3. The legendary chest that can appear above the control room on the top<br> floor of the main building.<br></p></font></center>

   <center>
    <font size="5px">
      <p>Iron Man is located in the control room, on the top floor of the main building —<br> on the right side of the building when facing the entrance. He'll defend himself<br> using a series of laser beams and will regularly launch a powerful laser attack<br> capable of destroying buildings and killing a player with a single shot.<br></p></font></center>

      <p>Eliminate Iron Man to recover :<br>
        <br>
        <br>
       1. Iron Man's Repulsor Gauntlets: a power that allows you to fire from a<br> distance to inflict 20 points of damage to a player.<br>
       <br>
       2. Iron Man's Unibeam: a power with a recovery time that shoots a powerful<br> ray through buildings and inflicts heavy damage.<br>
       <br>
       3. Iron Man Keycard.<br></p></font></center>
