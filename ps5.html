    <p>We've now glimpsed the PS5 design, seen the PS5 games line-up, including<br> Horizon Forbidden West and Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and know a lot about<br> the console's specs and features. These include an SSD for fast loading, ray<br>-tracing, a built-in 4K Blu-ray player, and backwards compatibility with thousands<br> of titles in the PS4's game library.<br>
        <br>
        However, and possibly more importantly, we now also know the PS5 price<br> and release date.<br>
        <br>
        The PS5 is a very different-looking console to the PS4, with its space-age black-<br>and-white color scheme looking a little different to PlayStations of the<br> past. There's more than one PS5 console releasing this year, though, as Sony has<br> also confirmed it's going to be releasing a PS5 Digital Edition – a streamlined,<br> digital-only console without a disc drive.<br>
        <br>
        Both consoles are going to be pretty powerful, from what we know about the<br> PS5 specs. We'll cover them in full below, but specs-wise, the PS5 (and its digital<br> alternative) is rocking an AMD Zen 2-based CPU with 8 cores at 3.5GHz, 16GB of<br> GDDR6 memory, and a custom RDNA 2 AMD GPU that puts out 10.28 TFLOPs of<br> processing power. That might sound like nonsense if you're not up on this kind<br> of jargon, but prospective PS5 players have a lot to be excited about.<br>
        <br> 
        We've got full PS5 details for you below, including detailed break downs of<br> pricing and availability, so read on to find out everything you need to know<br> about the PlayStation 5.<br></p></font></center>

            <p>The PlayStation 5 is launching this holiday, and Sony is releasing a new controller to go along with the<br> system. The PS5’s DualSense is a followup to the DualShock gamepads. It features the same basic structure<br> with symmetrical dual analog sticks and the familiar face buttons. But Sony is building on that foundation<br> with new features such as haptic feedback and adaptive-resistance triggers. The idea is to enable players to<br> feel their games.<br>
                <br>
                “We had a great opportunity with PS5 to innovate by offering game creators the ability to explore how they<br> can heighten that feeling of immersion through our new controller,” PlayStation platform boss Hideaki<br> Nishino wrote in a blog post. “This is why we adopted haptic feedback, which adds a variety of powerful<br> sensations you’ll feel when you play, such as the slow grittiness of driving a car through mud. We also<br> incorporated adaptive triggers into the L2 and R2 buttons of DualSense so you can truly feel the tension of<br> your actions, like when drawing a bow to shoot an arrow.”<br>
                <br>
                DualSense also includes multiple microphones, which enables you to communicate with friends even if<br> you don’t have a headset.<br>
                <br>
                Sony is also dropping the “Share” button and replacing it with “Create.” This introduces new ways for<br> players to create and share content from their gameplay.<br>
                <br>
                “Our goal with DualSense is to give gamers the feeling of being transported into the game world as soon as<br> they open the box,” said Nishino. “We want gamers to feel like the controller is an extension of themselves<br> when they’re playing – so much so that they forget that it’s even in their hands.”<br></p></font></center>

                    <p>Following Wednesday's big Sony PS5 price reveal, we now have pricing for the<br> dedicated PlayStation accessories that will go on sale with the new consoles. Two<br> PS5 peripherals have been on our radar since the consoles first appeared back<br> in June – the Pulse 3D wireless gaming headset and the new media remote.<br>
                       <br> 
                        If you want to experience 3D audio on the new PS5 or PS5 Digital Edition, you'll<br> need to invest in a pair of Pulse 3D headphones. And we now know they'll set<br> you back $99/€99 (UK pricing is still to be confirmed). That doesn't appear a bad<br> price on paper, given the Sony PlayStation Platinum Wireless Headset for the<br> current PS4 costs over £100/$130.<br>
                        <br>
                        Given the PS5 will also double as a 4K video streamer, you might want to ditch<br> the DualSense Wireless Controller for the PS5's dedicated Media Remote. This<br> white wand costs €29/$29. All of its features and functionality are yet to be<br> revealed, but hopefully, it will make short work of navigating menus for the likes<br> of Netflix, Amazon Video.<br></p></font></center>
